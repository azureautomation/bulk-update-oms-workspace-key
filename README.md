Bulk update OMS Workspace Key
=============================

            

I have already filled $servers, so unless you apply a new filter you can use $servers again.
With the bulk script below you update all servers in $servers. Do not forget to customize the WorkspaceID and WorkspaceKey.


Make sure to add your Workspace ID and Workspace Key.


The rest should speak for itself. 


[See my blog post for more.](https://www.baswijdenes.com/portfolio/bulk-update-oms-workspace-key-powershell/)


To check whether the servers also give the error message “*The agent could not authenticate with the Microsoft Operations Management Suite service. Please check that the Workspace Key is correct.*” you can run this in bulk.


 

 


        
    
TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
